Our foundation was laid in open source, and we have relied on
experts in various languages when we added them.

That tradition continues today, but with a little twist.

It is with our great pleasure we introduce support for three new languages.
These are a bit different from the ones we have put forth before:
Self-identified volunteers in the respective language communities
will develop, support, and document the language ecosystem.

The languages we introduce today, in alphabetical order, are:

## C# Support

[C#](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/csharp/) support is brought to you
by [Joshua Anderson](https://github.com/joshua-anderson),
[Alexander KÃ¶plinger](https://github.com/akoeplinger), and
[Nicholas Terry](https://github.com/nterry).

The language `csharp` can also be used to build F# and Visual Basic projects.

Microsoft's [C# Programming Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx)
gets you started on this multi-paradigm programming language.

## D Support

[Iain Buclaw](https://github.com/ibuclaw),
[David Nadlinger](https://github.com/klickverbot), and
[Martin Nowak](https://github.com/MartinNowak) bring you
[D](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/d/) support.

D is a language with C-like syntax and static typing. It pragmatically combines efficiency, control, and modeling power, with safety and programmer productivity.

For more information about the D programming language,
visit [http://dlang.org/](http://dlang.org/).

## Julia Support

Finally, [Tony Kelman](https://github.com/tkelman),
[Pontus Stenetorp](https://github.com/ninjin),
and [Elliot Saba](https://github.com/staticfloat) bring you
[Julia](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/julia) support.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing,
with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.

[http://julialang.org/](http://julialang.org/) is your official source for information
on Julia.

## What Does "Community Support" Mean?

As we added more and more languages to our arsenal, we found that
often our core team members lack the expertise to support more
languages that our community members asked for.

This is an experiment in which we rely explicitly on the community
to support the demands of their respective user base.

While Travis CI is not directly involved in support of these
languages, we are confident that these capable volunteers will
provide great support for their communities.

## What About Language X?

It is a great time to be software engineers, with many languages
to choose from.
We are grateful to have enthusiastic community members.

If the language of your choice is missing, perhaps you would like
to be the expert in that language.
You can look at GitHub issues [such](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/294)
[as](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/340)
[these](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/318)
and get an idea on how to volunteer.

If you have further questions, feel free to open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/new).

Happy testing!
