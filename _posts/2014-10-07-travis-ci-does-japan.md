# Travis CI does Japan!

Josh and Hiro traveled to Tokyo last month to attend [RubyKaigi](http://rubykaigi.org/2014).

Prior to that conference, we arranged a [special meetup](http://connpass.com/event/7901/)
for Travis CI users there.
This is a second one of its kind, the [first one](http://eytokyo.doorkeeper.jp/events/9606)
having taken place in March.

The mobile gaming company [DeNA](http://dena.com/intl/) graciously offered their Shibuya office space
for the meeting.
About 90 people attended.
It is safe to say that this was the largest Travis CI user meetup, ever.

Hiro live demoed setting up Travis CI from scratch
to include build matrix with allowed failures,
while Josh shared 10 things that can affect test results
on Travis CI.

To our great delight, the meetup also included 4 lightning talks by users.

After RubyKaigi, Hiro traveled on westward to Fukuoka, where he gave a similar live
demo to a group of about 16 users at GMO Pepabo.

It was exciting to meet Travis CI users in the Land of Rising Sun.
We hope to have more opportunities here and other places.
