[Josh](https://twitter.com/j2h) is making his way around the globe
from New Zealand to Berlin by way of Amazon re:Invent, and
[Hiro](https://twitter.com/hiro_asari) is on his way back from
RubyConf, and they're visiting Pittsburgh (where I live, yay!!)!

**This coming Friday, November 21st 2014, we'll be hanging out at
[Marty's Market in the Strip](http://martysmarket.com/)**, one of
our favorite coworking spots, **from 9:30am until 1pm**.

Coffee is on us, so do come by for a chat.
