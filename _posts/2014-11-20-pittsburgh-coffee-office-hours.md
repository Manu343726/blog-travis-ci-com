Josh is making his way around the globe from New Zealand to Berlin
by way of Amazon re:Invent, and Hiro is on his way back from
RubyConf, and they're visiting Pittsburgh (where I live, yay!!)!

**This coming Friday, November 21st 2014, we'll be hanging out at
[Marty's Market in the Strip](http://martysmarket.com/)**, one of
our favorite coworking spots, **from 9:30am until whenever** (or
8pm, but probably not that late).

Coffee is on us, so do come by for a chat.
